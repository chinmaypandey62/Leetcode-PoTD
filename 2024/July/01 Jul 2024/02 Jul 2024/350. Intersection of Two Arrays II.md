# LeetCode Problem: Intersection of Two Arrays II

## Problem Statement

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/)

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays, and you may return the result in any order.

## Intuition

To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap to count the occurrences of each number in one of the arrays. Then, we can iterate through the second array and collect the intersection by checking the hashmap and updating it accordingly.

## Approach

1. **Count Frequencies**: Use an unordered map to count the frequency of each element in `nums1`.
2. **Find Intersections**: Iterate through `nums2` and check if the element exists in the map with a non-zero count. If so, add it to the result and decrease the count in the map.
3. **Return Result**: Collect all the common elements in a result vector and return it.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> intersect(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freq1;
        for(int& i : nums1) ++freq1[i];

        vector<int> res;
        for(int& i : nums2)
            if(freq1[i]) res.push_back(i), --freq1[i];

        return res;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where `n` is the length of `nums1` and `m` is the length of `nums2`. We iterate through both arrays once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(min(n, m)), for storing the frequency counts in the hashmap.
