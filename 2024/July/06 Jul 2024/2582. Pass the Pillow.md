# LeetCode Problem: Pass the Pillow

## Problem Statement

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/pass-the-pillow/)

In a game of passing the pillow, `n` people sit in a circle and pass a pillow to the next person in a specified amount of time. The task is to determine the position of the person holding the pillow after a given amount of time.

## Intuition

The problem can be visualized as a circular sequence where the pillow is passed back and forth. After passing the pillow around `n` people, it reverses direction and continues passing back. We can use modular arithmetic to determine the position efficiently.

## Approach

1. **Calculate Position**: Compute the position in the sequence after the given time using modulo operation.
2. **Determine Direction**: Check if the position is in the forward pass or the reverse pass.
3. **Return Result**: Adjust the position accordingly to return the correct person holding the pillow.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int passThePillow(int n, int time) {
        int position = time % (2 * (n - 1));

        if (position < n) return position + 1;
        else return (2 * n) - position - 1;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(1), as the solution involves only a few arithmetic operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few integer variables to keep track of the position.
