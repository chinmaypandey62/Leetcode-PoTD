# LeetCode Problem: Maximum Gain of Two Substrings

## Problem Statement

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-removing-substrings/)

Given a string `s` and two integers `x` and `y`, you can perform two types of operations on the string:
1. Remove substring "ab" and gain `x` points.
2. Remove substring "ba" and gain `y` points.

The goal is to maximize the total points by removing the substrings in an optimal order.

## Intuition

To maximize the points, always prioritize removing the substring with the higher point value first. This strategy ensures that we are maximizing the gain at each step.

## Approach

1. **Determine Removal Priority**:
   - If `x > y`, prioritize removing "ab" first. Otherwise, prioritize removing "ba" first.

2. **Two-Pass Removal**:
   - **First Pass**: Remove all instances of the higher priority substring and accumulate points.
   - **Second Pass**: Remove all instances of the lower priority substring from the remaining string and accumulate points.

3. **Stack-Based Removal**:
   - Use a stack to help with removing substrings efficiently. For each character in the string, check if it forms the target substring with the top character of the stack. If it does, pop from the stack and add the corresponding points. Otherwise, push the character onto the stack.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumGain(string s, int x, int y) {
        string stack;
        int res = 0;
        char c1 = 'b', c2 = 'a';

        if (x > y) {
            c1 = 'a';
            c2 = 'b';
            swap(x, y);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            if (!stack.empty() && stack.back() == c1 && s[i] == c2) {
                res += y;
                stack.pop_back();
            } else {
                stack += s[i];
            }
        }

        string stk;
        for (int i = 0; i < stack.size(); ++i) {
            if (!stk.empty() && stk.back() == c2 && stack[i] == c1) {
                res += x;
                stk.pop_back();
            } else {
                stk += stack[i];
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. Each character is processed twice in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), used by the stack to store characters.
