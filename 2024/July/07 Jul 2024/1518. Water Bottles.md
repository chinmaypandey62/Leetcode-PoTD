# LeetCode Problem: Water Bottles

## Problem Statement

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/water-bottles/)

You are given `numBottles` full water bottles, each of which contains one liter of water. You can exchange `numExchange` empty water bottles for one full water bottle. The task is to find out the maximum number of liters of water you can drink.

## Intuition

To maximize the number of liters of water you can drink, you need to keep exchanging empty bottles for full ones as long as possible. 

## Approach

1. **Initialization**: Start with the given number of full bottles and initialize the result with this number.
2. **Exchange Process**: Continuously exchange empty bottles for full ones until you have fewer empty bottles than required for an exchange.
3. **Update Counters**: Keep track of the number of full bottles obtained and update the count of empty bottles after each exchange.
4. **Return Result**: The result is the total number of full bottles consumed.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numWaterBottles(int empty, int ex) {
        int res = empty;

        while(empty >= ex) {
            res += (empty / ex);
            empty = (empty / ex) + (empty % ex);
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), where `n` is the initial number of bottles. This is because the number of bottles decreases exponentially with each exchange.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few integer variables to keep track of the counts.
