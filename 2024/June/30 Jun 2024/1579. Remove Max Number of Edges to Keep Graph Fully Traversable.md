# LeetCode Problem: Max Number of Edges to Remove

## Problem Statement

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-max-number-of-edges-to-keep-graph-fully-traversable/)

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [type_i, u_i, v_i]` represents an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i` of type `type_i`. There are three types of edges:
- Type 1: Can be traversed by Alice only.
- Type 2: Can be traversed by Bob only.
- Type 3: Can be traversed by both Alice and Bob.

Your task is to remove the maximum number of edges such that after removing the edges, the graph is still fully traversable by both Alice and Bob. Return the maximum number of edges you can remove, or return `-1` if it is impossible for the graph to be fully traversable by both.

## Intuition

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that both Alice and Bob can fully traverse the graph independently. We can use the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to help with this. The idea is to use a greedy approach to maximize the number of removable edges by first considering the type 3 edges (usable by both Alice and Bob), and then processing the type 1 and type 2 edges separately.

## Approach

### Steps
1. **Union-Find Data Structure**: Create a Union-Find (DSU) class to help manage the connectivity of nodes.
2. **Process Type 3 Edges**: First, add all type 3 edges (usable by both Alice and Bob) to both Alice's and Bob's DSUs. Count the number of successful unions.
3. **Process Type 1 Edges**: Add all type 1 edges (Alice-only) to Alice's DSU and count the successful unions.
4. **Process Type 2 Edges**: Add all type 2 edges (Bob-only) to Bob's DSU and count the successful unions.
5. **Check Connectivity**: Check if both Alice's and Bob's graphs are fully connected.
6. **Calculate Removable Edges**: If both graphs are fully connected, the maximum number of removable edges is the total number of edges minus the number of successful unions. If either graph is not fully connected, return `-1`.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxNumEdgesToRemove(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        class UnionFind {
        public:
            vector<int> parent, size;
            int components;
            UnionFind(int n) {
                components = n;
                parent.resize(n + 1);
                size.resize(n + 1, 1);
                for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
                    parent[i] = i;
                }
            }

            int find(int x) {
                if (parent[x] != x) {
                    parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
                }
                return parent[x];
            }

            bool unite(int x, int y) {
                int rootX = find(x), rootY = find(y);
                if (rootX == rootY) return false;
                if (size[rootX] < size[rootY]) swap(rootX, rootY);
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                size[rootX] += size[rootY];
                components--;
                return true;
            }

            bool isConnected() {
                return components == 1;
            }
        };
        
        UnionFind alice(n), bob(n);
        int edgesRequired = 0;
        
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            if (edge[0] == 3) {
                if (alice.unite(edge[1], edge[2]) | bob.unite(edge[1], edge[2])) {
                    edgesRequired++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            if (edge[0] == 1) {
                if (alice.unite(edge[1], edge[2])) {
                    edgesRequired++;
                }
            } else if (edge[0] == 2) {
                if (bob.unite(edge[1], edge[2])) {
                    edgesRequired++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        if (alice.isConnected() && bob.isConnected()) {
            return edges.size() - edgesRequired;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(E log* V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices. This is due to the union-find operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V), for storing the DSU arrays (parent and size).
