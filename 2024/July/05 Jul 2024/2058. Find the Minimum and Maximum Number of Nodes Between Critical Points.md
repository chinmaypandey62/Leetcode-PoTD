# LeetCode Problem: Nodes Between Critical Points

## Problem Statement

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/nodes-between-critical-points/)

Given the head of a linked list, find the minimum and maximum distance between any two critical points. A critical point is a node in the linked list where the value is either a local maximum or a local minimum.

## Intuition

To find the critical points, we need to traverse the linked list and check for each node if it is a local maximum or a local minimum by comparing it with its previous and next nodes. Then, we can calculate the minimum and maximum distances between these critical points.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**: Set up initial variables to keep track of the previous node value, the index of the last critical point, the index of the first critical point, and the current node index.
2. **Traverse the List**: Iterate through the linked list and identify the critical points by comparing the current node value with its previous and next node values.
3. **Calculate Distances**: Update the minimum and maximum distances between critical points as they are found.
4. **Return Results**: If there are fewer than two critical points, return `{-1, -1}`. Otherwise, return the minimum and maximum distances.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> nodesBetweenCriticalPoints(ListNode* head) {
        vector<int> res(2, INT_MAX);
        int prev = head->val, prevC = -1000001, fst = 0, i = 0;
        
        head = head->next;
        if(!head->next) return {-1, -1};
        while(head->next) {
            ++i;
            int v = head->val, n = head->next->val;

            if((v > n && v > prev) || (v < n && v < prev)) {
                if(!fst) fst = i;

                res[0] = min(res[0], (i - prevC));
                prevC = i;
            }
            prev = v;
            head = head->next;
        }

        if(prevC == fst || !fst) return {-1, -1};
        res[1] = prevC - fst;

        return res;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), not counting the space for the output list. We only use a few integer variables and a vector of fixed size.
