# LeetCode Problem: Average Waiting Time

## Problem Statement

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-waiting-time/)

Given an array `customers` where `customers[i] = [arrival, time]` represents the arrival time and the time taken to prepare the order of the `i-th` customer, return the average waiting time of all customers. The waiting time of the `i-th` customer is the total time they have to wait from their arrival to the completion of their order.

## Intuition

To calculate the average waiting time, we need to consider both the waiting time due to previous orders and the preparation time of each order. The goal is to maintain a running total of the waiting times and then compute the average.

## Approach

1. **Initialize Variables**: Use `wait` to store the total waiting time and `currTime` to keep track of the current time.
2. **Iterate Over Customers**: For each customer, check if they have to wait due to previous customers or if they start immediately.
3. **Update Waiting Time and Current Time**: Add the appropriate waiting time for each customer and update the current time accordingly.
4. **Compute Average**: Return the average waiting time by dividing the total waiting time by the number of customers.

## Code

```cpp
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
static auto _ = []() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    cout.tie(nullptr);
    return 0;
}();

class Solution {
public:
    double averageWaitingTime(vector<vector<int>>& customers) {
        double wait = 0;
        int currTime = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < customers.size(); ++i) {
            if (customers[i][0] <= currTime) {
                wait += (currTime - customers[i][0]) + customers[i][1];
                currTime += customers[i][1];
            } else {
                wait += customers[i][1];
                currTime = customers[i][0] + customers[i][1];
            }
        }
        return (wait / customers.size());
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of customers. We iterate through the list of customers once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few variables to store the current time and total waiting time.
