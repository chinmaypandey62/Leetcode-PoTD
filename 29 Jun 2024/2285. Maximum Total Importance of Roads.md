# LeetCode Problem: Maximum Total Importance of Roads

## Problem Statement

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-total-importance-of-roads/)

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of cities, and a 2D integer array `roads` where `roads[i] = [ai, bi]` denotes that there exists a bidirectional road connecting cities `ai` and `bi`.

You need to assign each city a value from 1 to `n` such that the total importance of all roads is maximized. The importance of a road connecting cities `ai` and `bi` is equal to the sum of the values of cities `ai` and `bi`.

Return the maximum total importance of all roads.

## Intuition

To maximize the total importance of all roads, we should assign higher values to the cities with more connections. This way, the roads connected to these highly connected cities will have higher importance.

## Approach

### Approach 1
1. Use a vector to store the degree (number of connections) of each city.
2. Use a priority queue to sort cities based on their degree in descending order.
3. Assign the highest available values to the cities with the most connections.
4. Calculate the total importance by summing the values of all roads.

## Code

### Approach 1

```cpp
class Solution1 {
public:
    long long maximumImportance(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads) {
        ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
        cin.tie(NULL);
        cout.tie(NULL);

        vector<int> adj(n);

        for (int i = 0; i < roads.size(); i++) {
            adj[roads[i][0]]++;
            adj[roads[i][1]]++;
        }

        priority_queue<pair<int, int>> pq;
        for (int i = 0; i < adj.size(); ++i) {
            pq.push({adj[i], i});
        }

        vector<int> value(n);
        long long count = 0;

        while (!pq.empty()) {
            auto [_, idx] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();

            value[idx] = n--;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < roads.size(); i++) {
            count += (long long)value[roads[i][0]] + value[roads[i][1]];
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Approach 2

1. Use a vector to store the degree of each city.
2. Sort the degrees in ascending order.
3. Assign values from 1 to `n` to the cities based on the sorted degree.
4. Calculate the total importance by summing the values of all roads.

## Code

### Approach 2

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maximumImportance(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads) {
        ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
        cin.tie(NULL);
        cout.tie(NULL);

        vector<int> adj(n);

        for (int i = 0; i < roads.size(); i++) {
            adj[roads[i][0]]++;
            adj[roads[i][1]]++;
        }

        sort(adj.begin(), adj.end());
        long long count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < adj.size(); i++) {
            count += ((long long)(i + 1) * (adj[i]));
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Approach 1
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
  - Building the frequency array takes O(n).
  - Using the priority queue to sort cities based on their degree takes O(n log n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The frequency array and the priority queue take O(n) space.

### Approach 2
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
  - Building the frequency array takes O(n).
  - Sorting the frequency array takes O(n log n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The frequency array takes O(n) space.
