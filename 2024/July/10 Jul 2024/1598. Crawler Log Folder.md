# LeetCode Problem: Crawler Log Folder

## Problem Statement

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/crawler-log-folder/)

The task is to process a list of log operations and determine the minimum number of operations required to return to the main folder. Each log operation is one of the following:
- `"../"`: Move to the parent folder. (Decrement the depth if not at the main folder)
- `"./"`: Stay in the current folder. (No change in depth)
- A folder name: Move to a child folder. (Increment the depth)

## Intuition

The problem can be solved by simulating the folder traversal using a counter that tracks the current depth level. The counter is incremented for child folder operations, decremented for parent folder operations (if not at the root), and remains unchanged for no-op operations.

## Approach

1. **Initialize a Counter**: Use `count` to keep track of the current depth level.
2. **Iterate Through Logs**: For each log entry:
   - If the log is `"../"`, decrement the counter if it's greater than 0.
   - If the log is not `"./"`, increment the counter (indicating a move to a child folder).
3. **Return the Counter**: The final value of the counter will represent the minimum operations needed to return to the main folder.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<string>& logs) {
        int count = 0;

        for(string& s : logs) {
            if(s == "../") {
                if(count) --count;
            }
            else if(s != "./")  ++count;
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of log entries. Each log entry is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the algorithm only uses a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.
