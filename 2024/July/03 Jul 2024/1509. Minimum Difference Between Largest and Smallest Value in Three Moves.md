# LeetCode Problem: Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves

## Problem Statement

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-between-largest-and-smallest-value-in-three-moves/)

Given an array `nums`, you are allowed to make at most three moves. After these moves, return the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of `nums`.

## Intuition

To minimize the difference between the largest and smallest values after at most three moves, we can sort the array and consider removing up to three of the smallest or largest elements. By examining the difference between various pairs of elements, we can determine the minimal possible difference.

## Approach

1. **Handle Small Arrays**: If the size of the array is less than 5, return 0 because we can remove all elements in three moves.
2. **Sort the Array**: Sorting the array helps in easily finding the smallest and largest elements.
3. **Evaluate Possible Moves**: Consider removing up to three of the smallest or largest elements. Calculate the difference between the remaining elements and keep track of the minimum difference.
4. **Return Result**: Return the smallest difference found.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDifference(vector<int>& nums) {
        if(nums.size() < 5) return 0;
        int res = INT_MAX;
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        for(int i = 3, j = nums.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i, --j) {
            int t = nums[j] - nums[i];
            res = min(res, t);
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. The sorting step dominates the time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since no additional space proportional to the input size is used, aside from a few integer variables.
