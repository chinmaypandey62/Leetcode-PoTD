# LeetCode Problem: Find Center of Star Graph

## Problem Statement

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-center-of-star-graph/)

There is an undirected star graph consisting of `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly `n - 1` edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an edge between the nodes `ui` and `vi`. Return the center of the given star graph.

## Intuition

To find the center of a star graph, we can use the property that the center node will appear in every edge. 

## Approach

### Approach 1
1. Create a frequency array to count the occurrences of each node.
2. Iterate through the `edges` array and update the frequency array.
3. Iterate through the frequency array to find the node that appears `n - 1` times.

### Approach 2
1. Since the center node will appear in the first two edges, we can simply compare the nodes in these edges.
2. Check if the first node of the first edge is equal to either of the nodes in the second edge.
3. If true, return the first node of the first edge; otherwise, return the second node of the first edge.

## Code

### Approach 1

```cpp
class Solution1 {
public:
    int findCenter(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<int> freq(edges.size() + 2, 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < edges.size(); ++i) {
            ++freq[edges[i][0]];
            ++freq[edges[i][1]];
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < freq.size(); ++i) 
            if (freq[i] == edges.size()) return i;

        return 0;
    }
};
```

### Approach 2

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findCenter(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        if (edges[0][0] == edges[1][0] || edges[0][0] == edges[1][1]) return edges[0][0];

        return edges[0][1];
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Approach 1
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - Iterating through the `edges` array takes O(n) time.
  - Iterating through the frequency array also takes O(n) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The frequency array takes O(n) space.

### Approach 2
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only a constant number of operations are performed.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - No additional space is required.
